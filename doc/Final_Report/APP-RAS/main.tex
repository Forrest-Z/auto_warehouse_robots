% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


\usepackage{mdwmath}
\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley and Jeff Goldberg.
% This package may be useful when used in conjunction with IEEEtran.cls'
% captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that submissions
% have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.3.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% For subfigure.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfigure\subfigure
% \renewcommand{\subfigure}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfigure[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat/subfig command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Motivation}
A smart factory environment is an important aspect of "Industry 4.0" where products can be ordered, produced, sorted, stored in a warehouse and finally delivered to the recipient. The different
parts of the scenario are modular and hence the information exchange between the modules is limited.
\\
The goal of our project is to implement a scalable system for cooperative multi-agent task and path planning. The project is used in a warehouse scenario, where robot agents have to store packages into shelves as per the tasks issued. 
These packages theoretically arrive without any pre-planning and hence the system should be able to accommodate for the unpredictable demand. 
\\
To increase efficiency the transportation, multiple robots have to work in parallel in a limited driving space of a warehouse and with co-ordination with the other robots to avoid collisions.
\\
Congestion is another conundrum that this system has to consider. The robots will lose valuable time if they have to wait due to congestion, reducing lower the overall effectiveness of the warehouse system.
\\
This project strives to provide a solution for the problem of assigning packages to the robots, planning the driving paths of the robots and coordinating them. The problem can be split into two separate parts: the task planning and the path planning. Both parts have to incorporate the coordination aspect.
\\
The task planning is concerned with assigning incoming packages to the robots considering the time needed to store the package, energy consumption of the robots and overall optimality as far as possible given that the packages arrive
randomly. The technical challenge here is to find an algorithm can assign a package to the best robot under the previously mentioned considerations.
\\
The path planning is concerned with finding and traversing an optimal path for a robot between two points in the known area of indoor warehouse, with consideration of the other moving robots, non-holonomity criteria for optimality reasons and a continuous, non-linear environment. The technical problem is to find an algorithm which plans an optimal path for a robot under the
previously mentioned considerations.
\\
\subsection{Problem Defination}
A successful implementation of the project will go through following steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item The project starts with receiving a package that is to be stored in the warehouse.
\item The pick-up point on which the package arrives and the drop-off point, where the package is to be stored, together constitute a task that has to be assigned to a robot. An example of such a task would be to place the package from the input tray to the storage tray. 
\item The system should accordingly decide a storage tray and assign the task to a suitable robot agent.
\item The agent should be able to successfully navigate through the environment using the path and task planner and deliver the package. Thus, finishing the task
\item The system must be stable enough to be able to perform multiple tasks concurrently and accommodate for inter-robot interactions.  
\end{itemize} 
\subsection{Related Literature}
how literature approaches to it (very briefly as we have a related works section)

\subsection{Approach}
To approach this problem, we first considered the state of the initial framework which was given. We received a morse-ros project which already included: 
1. A functioning morse environment for indoor warehouse with a demo map 2. ROS environment with essential components, excluding path and task planning. 3. A bridge between ROS and Morse environments.  
\\
The first step was to classify problem into different tasks. The main tasks were Path planning and Task Planning and then we divided them further into subtasks. After literature survey, we decided on top-level system that we will try to implement. For example: using decentralized architecture for path planning with coordination within the robot agents for path reservations. Accordingly we set following goals to be met:
\begin{itemize}
\item Goal 1
%Goals summerized here
\end{itemize}
In the second step, we started by analysing our minimum goal: To successfully implement task and path planning with multi robot collaboration and then setting it for milestone 2. For path planning the research and demo implementation of the algorithm was first step. We compared and demonstrated different path planning approaches such as Theta* and RRT* on a C++ based environment and decided our milestones for implementations on ROS. Another important aspect of our system was Multi-Robot collaboration, which we decided to implement after the second milestone.  A detail working of the system will be explained in \ref{sec:Methodology}.
%%MIlestone picture
\\
Finally, we decided to analyse the results based on a number of criterion which we thought might be useful for a warehousing scenario. For example: average time taken for a successful completion of the task and average time spent in different activities by each robot agent. These parameters are indicative of some interesting matrics such as what is the impact of increasing number of robots on the system and how often a robot agent needs charging. More ecaluation methods and results will be explained in \ref{sec:Results} 

\section{Related Works}

Please inspire from your SDS, but this time make it more elaborated. It should be clear that how the problems you stated was approached in general, and how you approached with a brief paragraph. Which studies were really inspiring to you and in what sense. You should mention those. Do not forget to cite the works, both in introduction and here [1].



\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:Methodology}


\subsection{Overview}
You should start with describing your project, how you approach the problems state under introduction (now in detail), overall architecture and briefly describing each part of the architecture. Your architecture drawing (with its last version) will be placed here. An example figure is shown in Fig. 1. 


\subsection{Main Components of the system}
Now that you described the overall architecture, it is time to elaborate more the subparts you set out above. Answer the question of how you implemented each part. What this module involves and the clear methodology followed (e.g. “POMDP model is used here inspired from [?] as the robot’s planner”).

\section{Results}
\label{sec:Results}

Think about how you can show your project’s performance. This is the most important section that will reflect your entire project, therefore it comes with the most weight on the grading of the Final Report. Therefore, analyze well what your project promises and how you can NUMERICALLY show this. Then, you discuss on the findings. Sub-sections can be created freely.
\\
Usually, the common metrics to be used are: 
\begin{itemize}

\item
overall accuracy in estimation (of whatever you are estimating: e.g. human belief, human activity, object type + shape, object pose, comparing the estimated time to store a pkg of a robot and the real time of realization etc).
Of course for such analysis you need multiple runs of the system
Don’t forget to separate the training set from the test set (80% of your entire dataset is for training, 20% is to test)

\item
overall success / precision (of the overall decisions your system makes: e.g. robotA is the most suitable for loading and storing pkg, comparison of the average time a task is realized with or without this component shows the impact of the component.)

\end{itemize}

If you can show your results on graphics it is a BONUS. If you can show on such graphs that how changing of some parameters of your mehtods/env. conditions/the context in the scenario etc. would affect your system’s performance, then you will receive +10 points for your overall document. 
\\
As the first step, you start discussing on what sort of results you will show and we will definitely discuss them in the upcoming two weeks. Feel free to suggest and ask anything on that phase (be brave !).
\\
Finally, you will conclude with the discussion of these results you showed/described. Basically answer this question, what these results tell you? Even though they are bad /not significant then you need to comment on why it is how it is. There HAS TO BE A DISCUSSION even though it is short. 
\\
You can also criticize your approach and offer better ones if it would lead to better performances. You can also briefly discuss the points to be improved/extended in your system. You will get the GRADES FROM THE DISCUSSION more than the significance or the performance of your results. In the past some groups got the highest grades although their system didn’t work well. Your goal is not to build an end product, but to be aware of what you build, a strong code base and discussion points for us to improve on your code. Positive results are of course a plus.
